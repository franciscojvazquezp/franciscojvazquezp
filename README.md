# Francisco Javier Vazquez
With 13 years of experience in the automotive industry as a process engineer and site manager, I have honed my skills and developed deep expertise in these fields. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with high-profile clients
in a multi cultural enviroment leading projects to install welding assembly lines in Mexico and USA. My passion for measuring the impact of the carried out activities has led me to self-directed learning in coding languages to enhance my skills as 
a Data Analyst further.\
\
As a Process Engineer, I collected and analyzed data from part measurements, cycle time measurements, and welding parameters to transform this information into optimizations that increased productivity, while for managing projects, I led 
multidisciplinary teams to install production lines, ensuring compliance with process requirements and the quality standards of the components assembled on those lines.\
\
My constant curiosity about data led me to take the TripleTen bootcamp, where I discovered my passion for data analysis through various tools (Python, SQL, Excel, Pandas) and understood the close relationship that my new profession has with my experience in the automotive industry.\
\
This GitHub repository showcases a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, including work with SQL, Python, and various data visualization tools. These projects highlight my ability to apply analytical techniques to real-world business problems, providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations.
